Adds Elastic Cloud support and increases VM disk size

- Adds support for `ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_ID` and `ELASTICSEARCH_API_KEY` for a more secure and direct connection to Elastic Cloud.
- Updates the Elasticsearch client logic to prioritize the Cloud ID connection method.
- Increases the default boot disk size for the Compute Engine worker to 100GB in the deployment guide.
- Updates the `.env.example` and deployment guide to reflect the new Elasticsearch connection variables.

Prompts:

- "I need to make the worker instance disk larger"
- "100GB would be sufficent"
- "Is there an easy way to increase an existing one?"
- "Can you add an env variable for the ELASTICSEARCH_CLOUD_ID and include that when available?"
